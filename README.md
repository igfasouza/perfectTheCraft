So, what do we need to start studying?

* Books (loads of them) and some notepad.
** Kindle (avoids backlight/bluelight)

* A whiteboard (YEAH!)

* A computer / laptop to test your code 
** It is also nice to check the performance of the function ( Not strictly necessary but I like to keep things more tangible).
