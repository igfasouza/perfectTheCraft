So, what do we need to start studying?

* Books (loads of them) and some notepad.
  * Kindle (avoids backlight/bluelight)
  * ![books_and_notepad](/images/books_and_notepad.jpg)
   
* A whiteboard (YEAH!)

* A computer / laptop to test your code
  * It is also nice to check the performance of the function ( Not strictly necessary but I like to keep things more tangible).
